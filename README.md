== GENERAL BOT INFO ==

This piece of code is a User Welcomer with Image Manipulation using Python and Pillow (PIL).
Since I haven't found any good solutions on this I decided to code it myself and upload it on GitHub so everybody can use it :)
Everything can be adjusted to your preferences. The whole code is commented so you know what the line does and what to change for your Bot!

== Deploy and Host ==

If you need help with deploying your bot and hosting it so it is online 24/7 you can contact me on Discord (bero#0001)! I offer you to host up to 5 Bots for only 5$/month!
Your code is 100% secure and won't be published anywhere. Also my Server has a good performance so you shouldn't be afraid of high response times! ;)

Don't mind sending me a friend request! I will try to answer all of your questions and problems.
